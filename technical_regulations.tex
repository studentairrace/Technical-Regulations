\section{Definitions}
\subsection{Vehicle Coordinate Frame Definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The XY-Plane is defined as a imaginary plane parallel to the ground when the aircraft is in landed position with the landing gear extended. The position of the plane is defined by the intersection point of the lowest rotor shaft axis with its coressponding rotor disk.
  \item The z-Axis is defined as an axis perpendicular to the xy-plane. It intersects the XY-plane in the aircrafts center of gravity. As usual in a Body-Fixed Aircraft frame the positive direction is pointin downwards in most cases.
  \item The Coordinate frames must be clearly marked and made visible in the competitors technical report. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Propeller Disks}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Power Units}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A power unit is considered to be a lift producing actuator and its control electronics. In the classical multicopter design this means one specific Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) on the UAS, the motor behind it and the propeller attached to this motor would be considered as one single powertrain.
  \item An UAS must not have more than a maximum of 16 powerunits.
  \item The vehicle must be able to be able to safely continue a stable flight if any single power unit fails.  
\end{enumerate}



\section{Environmental Envelope}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The aircraft must be able to be operated in the following conditions. All these conditions must be met in order to start any flights:
\begin {itemize}
  \item The aircraft must be able to operate in temperatures between 5째C and 30째C.
  \item The relative humidity must stay within 20\% and 90\%. 
  \item The average windspeed must stay below 6m/s. Gusts may not be exceed 10m/s within one hour before and during the flight.
  
\end {itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Aircraft Performance Requirements}

\subsection{Vehicle MTOW}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Maximum Weight of the vehicle during scruteneering must not exceed 22.5kg.
  \item The organizer will publish the weights of Equipement which must be used during the competition and thus added to the vehicle beforehand. Those weights wound count towards the maximum weight. 
  However the teams should plan their calculations for the vehicle with those weights added. The Maximum Takeoff Weight with this Equipement will not pass 25kg.  
  \item The Weight of the vehicle during scruteneering must at exceed 15kg.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Vehicle Thrust}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The minimum Thrust measured on the vehicle Thrust Test Stand must exceed 800N under standard atmospheric conditions.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Electronics}

\subsection{Power Source}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The aircrafts power source must be electric. All motors and acutators on the aircraft must also be electrically driven.
  \item Vehicles powerd by combustion engines, \textcolor{red}{Hydrogen Cells or comparable fuel burning devices} are not permitted. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Onboard Electronics}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The maximum DC voltage between two electrical connections on the UAS is 60V.
  \item The teams are allowed to fit different kinds of batteries on the aircraft if they are legal to operate on UAS and not pose a significantly higher safety hazard than a Lipo Battery. 
  \item Each battery used in the propulsion system must have a fuse directly in-line with its positive
  terminal that has a maximum continuous current rating equal to or less than the maximum continuous discharge rating of the battery. i.e. A-hr x maximum continuous (constant) Coulomb rating. (REWRITE THIS RULE AS IT IS DIRECTLY COPIED FROM VFS)
  \item Aircraft must have a separate power source for the flight control system. A LiPo battery that also follows the specifications under point 3 and throughout the RFP must be used, except that it can differ in capacity from the propulsion system battery/batteries.
  \item \emph{Should we add an emegency shutdown switch? How do they work? How do they deal with the high current on the vehicles? ?}
\end{enumerate}



\section{Aircraft Geometry}

\subsection{Vehicle Configurations}

  \item The rotor disks may overlap when viewed in the xy-plane if a necessary seperation between the rotors during full-thrust with a safety factor of 3 or more at the closest position is ensured. If the distance between both disks exceeds at least 1/4 of the propeller diameter no prove is necessary, prove for must be provided by the teams in their safety report. 
  \item Rotors whichs rotor disks overlap or mesh within each other are not permitted. Even if mechanically or electronically coupled.

\end{enumerate}





\section{Aircraft Subsystems}

\subsection{Internal Cooling}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fans with a maximum diameter of 50mm are allowed to be fitted anywhere on the vehicle. These do not count as rotors and thus do not need to follow the orientation rule from earlier.

  \item Teams may preheat their batteries to an optimum operating temperature with external tools such as heating boxes or heating blankets.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Standardized Parts}

  \item The teams will be provided with a standardized camera and sensor housing which goes on top of the UAS.
  \item \emph{What kind of mounting plate/adapter does this need?}
  \item \emph{Do we supply the teams only with a mockup and specifications attach the actual camera in the final competition?}
  \item \emph{What FOV does the camera need? How do we define the exact position?}
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Avionics suite}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{How big and heavy does the avionics suite need to be?}
  \item \emph{Which kinds of instruments/sensors do we put in there?}
  \item \emph{Should we attach some sort of safety shut off switch into this avionics box?}
  \item \emph{Will this box be connected to the T-Wing or exist on it's own?}
  \item \emph{Where do we put this avionics box?}
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Timing Equipement}
\begin{enumerate}

  \item \emph{Where will the teams mount this Equipement?}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Safety Systems}

\subsection{Shunt Plug}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The purpose of the shunt plug is to provide an easy and quick way to manually disarm the
  aircraft.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A shunt plug must be wired between the leads of the battery system and the electronic speed
    controller for manual disarming and arming of the aircrafts power system.
    \item The shunt plug must be red.
    \item The shunt plug must be removable with only one hand and without any tool.
    \item The tip of the shunt plug, where someone would grab it, must be located outside the dotted
    line as shown in Figure 6, below.
    \item The dotted line, if extended both into and out of the page, creates a box around the aircraft
    that extends outward from the rotors by 6 inches in all directions. Hint: Placing the shunt plug aft of the vehicle may be the best solution for aerodynamic and stability purposes in forward flight.
    \item A physical switch mounted on the drone would not be permitted and is not considered a valid shunt plug.
  \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ground Emergency Switch}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Teams need to at least have a special kill switch programmed to their Transmitter or console from which they control the aircraft. This kill switch needs to shut down all flight controller motor outputs. 
  \item An arm/disarm switch is not sufficient as a kill switch.
  \item The aircraft needs to be equipped with a Land function which autonomously lands the aircraft at the current position. A switch needs to be bound on the Transmitter/Ground Station from which the team controls the aircraft from.  
  \item \emph{Which Devices will be supported by the organizers? Which do the teams need to buy?}
  \item \emph{Where do the teams have to put the emergency shut down devices?}
  \item \emph{Do the devices operate relays or shut downn via MAVLINK?}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Remote Emergency System}

  \item 
  \item 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Regulatory Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The aircrafts themselves as well as their operation, must be certifiable within the EASA A3 class in Germany. To fall within this class a selfbuild aircraft, must follow rules which are set out by the authorities. 
  The following points include some of them yet not include all information necessary. Competitors will need to do their own research and make sure to keep up to date with the regulatory requirement on their own:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The aircraft must have a tag.
    \item The aircraft must not exceed 25kg MTOW. This includes equipement attached by the organizer.
    \item The aircraft must be insured with a drone insurace specifically applicable in Germany and with a sum of more than 750.000 SZR. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
